## ❔ What is it? ❔

A project that I started in week 3  (Front End Dev week) of the School of Code bootcamp.

## 💻 Why is it here? 💻

I took the html and css that we built that week and rewrote the javascript. I continue to tinker with it as a project to test myself with and to potentially add new functionality to as I continue through the bootcamp.
